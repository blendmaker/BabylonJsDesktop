# BabylonJsDesktop
A very basic implementation to use BabylonJS inside of an Electron window, compiled with Typescript.

## How to run the demo
You need to have NodeJs / npm installed, to install required dependencies (BabylonJs, Electron & typescript).

Clone this repository, install dependencies, compile and run it:
```git clone https://github.com/blendmaker/BabylonJsDesktop.git BabylonJsDesktop
cd BabylonJsDesktop
npm i
npm start
```

If anything doesn't work, please check you have ```npm``` installed and if needed, set up an issue.
